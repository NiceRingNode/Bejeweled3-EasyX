# Bejeweled3-EasyX
A rough application mocking classic game Bejeweled3 using C++ and Easyx
## This is a visual studio project, which was written and run using VS2019.
First you should install Easyx, a highly encapsulated graphics library. See more about this library [here](https://easyx.cn/).
Then double click file **Bejeweled3.sln**(recommended using VS2019 to open it). Set the C++ standard to C++14(or higher).
Then just click the **build** option and the game will be successfully run.
